        You want some?
      - How'd we do?
      - $27.
      Nobody questions shrink wrap.
      - Are you hungry?
      - A little bit. The <div class="mention">dog</div> probably is a lot.
      Good job.
      Can you stop touching my hair?
      Hey, his collar slipped off.
      And you waited right here.
      What a good boy. Yes, you are!
      Oh, we missed you too, buddy.
      I hope he knows what we go through
      just to feed him.
      All right, here you go, Friday.
      I've never seen a <div class="mention">dog</div>
      eat that much. Ever.
      Here you go.
      Nice catch.
      Go.
      Go.
      Meet us at home, Friday.
      Excuse me, miss.
      That's her.
      She's the one who ripped me off.
      Thank goodness you're here, Officer.
      This guy's been stalking me all day,
      and it's really freaking me out.
      Okay, thanks. I really appreciate it.
      Either I call you or
      I have to fill out all the forms.
      - Love to Alice.
      - Yeah. Same to Carol.
      Central City PD, precinct desk.
      Hold on, I'll transfer you.
      Put it down.
      - Hey.
      - Hey, Bernie.
      Don't "Hey, Bernie" me.
      You know I have half a mind
      to leave you two here?
      You're sprung. Come on, let's go.


      Hurry up.


      I'll do the rest of my yelling
      while I'm taking you back.


      Look, the guy
      could have pressed charges.


      You sold him a rock in a box
      for 20 bucks.


      Oh, that's funny?


      It's not funny. It's anything but funny.


      What if they'd called Carl and Lois
      instead of me?


      I guess you'd have to find us
      new foster parents, then.


      Is that what you're trying to do?


      You guys, that's
      a very dangerous game, I'm telling you.


      One and...


      No.


      You know, the word "harmonizing"
      comes from the word "harmony."


      - So?
      - So I'm saying you're still half a step off.


      Oh, really? Well, that's funny
      because my vocal instructor,


      who is a paid vocal instructor,
      didn't notice that, but you did.


      Here's the note.


      You're late.
      And you interrupted rehearsal.


      I'm very sorry.


      Get in there. Hurry up.


      Babe, maybe we should skip this one
      and just play the hit.


      - They're all hits, baby.
      - You're right.


      - Hey, Bernie.
      - Carl.


      Your food's on your trays.


      Yummy! It's too bad we already ate.


      Fine. It'll be lunch tomorrow.


      All right, could we just get back
      to the issue at hand, okay?


      I'm a kind woman. Okay?


      In fact, everyone's always asking,
      "Lois, why are you so kind?"


      But we have rules. Okay?


      We serve dinner at a certain time, so
      we can finish dinner at a certain time.


      So we can drop our rock manifesto
      on the world at a certain time.


      Okay, but those times have come
      and gone. So...


      Oh, where were they?


      Look, this whole thing is my fault. Okay?


      We were just getting caught up
      and we were having so much fun...


      Whoa. Yeah.


      ...that I just lost track of time.
      I'm sorry, really. My apologies.


      Now, why don't we just
      get them to their room


      and you guys can continue
      making that magic.


      - Thanks for covering for us.
      - Andi, Andi. Listen!


      You cannot afford to screw this up.


      You've only been here
      two months, okay?


      This is your fifth set
      of foster parents in three years.


      The Johnsons don't count,
      we were there for two hours.


      Do you know the reaction I get
      when I tell people


      I'm trying to place
      11 and 16-year-old siblings?


      It ain't a good one. Okay?
      You guys mess this up, that's it.


      I don't have any more favors
      I can call in.


      I'm gonna have to
      place you two separately.


      No! You know I won't
      let that happen, Bernie.


      We stay together.


      All right, then
      take a little advice from me, okay?


      A technique that I've learned.
      When somebody who I...


      ...who I don't particularly like is saying
      something that I don't want to hear,


      I just nod and I go, "Mmm-hmm."
      It works wonders.


      Mmm-hmm.


      Okay, I'm through with you guys.


      I'll tell you what, I better not get
      any more phone calls


      about a trick with a brick
      or a scam with a ham...


      Okay, it was a good talk, Bernie.
      Thank you very much for stopping by.


      What are you guys...


      Good boy. Somebody's tired today, huh?


      I am.


      Friday.


      - Andi.
      - Yeah.


      - Friday's gone.
      - What?


      - Friday, come here.
      - Where'd he go?


      Good God.


      You two are just a bundle of energy.


      Good morning!


      Stop shouting.


      My vocal instructor said getting
      frightened is bad for my pitch.


      What are you doing up so early?


      - Just thought we'd get some...
      - Breakfast!


      All right, so, I unlocked the pantry.


      Your cereal's in there.
      You know how to get it.


      I'm not your servant. All right?


      I am obliged to prepare two meals
      a day, that's lunch and dinner.


      Friday!


      What?


      I said,
      "Bruce, what is the day after Thursday?"


      - Friday!
      - Thanks.


      Fine. Get weird on me.
      I can handle weird.


      Okay, I don't need your attitude
      about setting the table, okay?


      Don't be lazy.


      It needs cinnamon.


      Or is it cinnamon that Carl's allergic to?


      Well, one way to find out, I guess.


      Let's see him harmonize
      with a tongue the size of a beehive.


      Wait! You just reminded me
      of this really funny story.


      I was walking and I stepped on a bee
      and it stung me.


      So then, I went and took care of my foot,


      then I went back for the bee
      to throw it outside and I thought,


      "You know, I'd be safe because
      bees can't sting you more than once."


      Right? I mean, right? It was crazy.
      I mean, isn't that crazy?


      Excuse me.


      You owe me 30 seconds of my life,
      and I will collect.


      Thanks for the heart attack.


      Of course I checked in there,
      maybe they're in the kids' room.


      Carl, did you eat the bacon?


      Stay close, Friday.


      Did I leave my whitening strips in here?


      He'd usually be here by now.


      You know, maybe he can't hear it.


      It's mealtime.
      He could hear it on the moon.


      He's probably just wandering around.


      Friday! Friday!


      - What are we gonna do?
      - Come on. Friday!


      Friday! Come on!
      Maybe he ran down this alley.


      Friday!


      You don't think he went in there,
      do you?


      No. Why would he go in there?
      He's probably just out looking for food.


      Friday!


      How cute. I want one.


      Nice haircut.


      Thanks, Dave.
      I was hoping you'd notice.


      Oh, I was actually
      talking about the Pomeranian.


      But yours is, yours is really nice, too.


      - You did something new to it.
      - I did.


      And I'm pretty sure you could tell
      when I first got it done


      because you kind of looked at me
      and then looked away,


      and then looked back like,
      "Hey, something's different."


      But then you didn't say anything
      and I was like, "Men."


      So then the next day I tried
      to compliment you on your hair,


      you know,
      giving you a little hint here but...


      No, absolutely. I totally remember that.
      Anyways, it looks great.


      Can I help you?


      No, no, we're just looking for our <div class="mention">dog</div>.


      I don't suppose you've seen him,
      have you?


      No.


      Friday? That's a funny name.


      I bet when you find him, you'll say,
      "Thank God it's Friday."


      Right? It's a joke. So...


      I don't think
      I've ever seen you around here before.


      - Do you go to Thomas Jefferson?
      - I will actually, in the fall. Andi.


      Dave.


      My family just moved here
      a couple of months ago.


      That's cool. How do you like it so far?


      What's not to like?


      - We have to go.
      - No problem.


      You know, if he doesn't show up soon,
      you might want to check the pound.


      - Friday! Friday! There he is!
      - There he is.


      - There he is.
      - There he is! Friday! Friday!


      - Your <div class="mention">dog</div>?
      - Yeah, that's our <div class="mention">dog</div>!


      Yeah, he just got in.


      Yeah, I know, we just saw him.


      Well, I'm always glad
      when these things have a happy ending.


      We're open till 6:00. Get your parents,
      come back, we'll figure it out.


      Wait! Wait...


      Come on, we're already here.
      It's our <div class="mention">dog</div>.


      Yeah, well, there's a lot of paperwork.
      Grown-up paperwork.


      There's always a guy
      who screws up the paperwork.


      But you see this guy? I'm not that guy.


      We can't let him out alone anymore.


      I mean, if he gets picked up again,
      we might not get him back.


      And things are gonna get
      so much harder when school starts.


      Look, Bruce, I think we need
      to find Friday a new home.


      - Well, you know, I've got a few ideas.
      - No.


      We've been hiding him
      in alleys and garages,


      in the woods for three years.


      Don't you think he deserves
      a real home with a real family?


      But we are a real family.


      Let's get out of here.


      - You kids! Hold it right there!
      - We can't get in trouble again.


      - But we didn't do anything wrong.
      - You want to tell them that?


      Oh, my God.


      - Friday! No! Get back here!
      - Bruce!


      Come on.


      - You got anything?
      - No.


      Forget it.


      Let's just find Friday
      and get out of here.


      Friday!


      Circuits are fried.


      Friday!


      Bruce, stay close.


      Wow. Andi, look at all this stuff.


      Careful.


      Friday?


      Friday, where are you, boy?


      - What's that?
      - It's just an old hotel.


      Hotels don't make footsteps.


      People make footsteps when they walk
      through hotels with their feet.


      Good point. Come on!


      Go, go, go!


      Friday, stay back.


      Do you think they belong to anyone?


      If they did, would they be here?


      Better here than the pound.


      Friday! Wait!


      - Look at that.
      - Okay.


      What about just, you know,
      leaving Friday with them tonight?


      One night.


      Good night, guys. Sleep tight.


      So I mean it's supposed to be
      a teacher appreciation lunch, right?


      But then it ends up
      being more work for us


      if we have to set it up
      and then clean it up.


      I mean, sometimes, you know,


      I could appreciate
      a little less appreciation, you know?


      Don't nod and "Mmm-hmm" me.
      I taught you the nod and "Mmm-hmm."


      Yeah, that's true,
      but I'd like to think I've made it my own.


      Oh, really?


      - What's wrong?
      - It's these kids, the other night.


      - Andi and Bruce?
      - Yeah.


      - Are they okay?
      - I don't know.


      I mean, it's bad enough
      they lost their parents.


      If they can't work this situation out,


      I don't know if we're gonna be able
      to find a family


      that's gonna take the both of them.


      You do everything you can for them,
      you know.


      You can't bring home
      your work and let it make you crazy.


      - You're right.
      - Yeah.


      - Love you.
      - Love you, too.


      It's too bad.
      You know, they really are good kids.


      It's three hungry <div class="mention">dog</div>s.
      Grab as much as you can.


      That's quite a load there.


      Yeah. Just getting some breakfast.


      What, are you feeding
      the whole neighborhood?


      Okay, you wouldn't even touch this
      the first time.


      I don't eat, you're angry.
      I eat, you're angry.


      Okay, fine, people, eat.
      Lucky for you I saved your dinners.


      You can start with those.


      Come on.


      What is that?


      You know, if you would eat
      the meals I make,


      you wouldn't be so hungry
      in the morning.


      You're right. Thank you so much, Lois.


      Done.


      I'm hearing something.


      What?


      - What's his problem?
      - I don't know. Why are you asking me?


      Stop howling, please.


      Yes, I'd like to call in a complaint
      about a howling <div class="mention">dog</div>.


      That's it?


      All that just so
      you could look out a window?


      Never mind.


      Wow. Even Lenny
      and Georgia won't touch it.


      We need to go get
      some real <div class="mention">dog</div> food for them.


      Wait, who?


      Lenny and Georgia.
      That's what I named the new <div class="mention">dog</div>s.


      No. No naming them.


      If you name them,
      you're gonna get attached.


      Andi, look at her.
      Tell me she's not a Georgia.


      Bruce, I'm not kidding, okay?


      I'm glad
      that Friday's getting along well with


      <div class="mention">dog</div> number one and <div class="mention">dog</div> number two,
      but we're barely keeping our <div class="mention">dog</div> safe.


      I mean, do you know what happens
      if we get caught in here?


      Trespassing, breaking and entering.


      You heard what Bernie said.
      They'd split us up and ship us off.


      Are you even listening?


      So I'll stay here and keep them quiet


      while you go out
      and get some real food. Okay?


      Okay, fine. But just for now.
      And I'll be back.


      Stay, Friday. Stay, Georgia.


      You better keep them quiet.


      You like to fetch.


      - Hey. I see you found your <div class="mention">dog</div>.
      - Yeah. He's fine.


      That's great.


      - Can I help you find anything?
      - No, just getting some <div class="mention">dog</div> food.


      - That's 40 pounds, by the way.
      - Yeah, that's probably right.


      For that little <div class="mention">dog</div> on the flier,
      40 pounds?


      Well, the thing is, I actually...
      I have three <div class="mention">dog</div>s,


      two of them are strays.


      - My parents, they just love animals.
      - That's great.


      Yeah. You know, they're the best.
      I'm really lucky.


      We have this big yard
      and we just rescue <div class="mention">dog</div>s all the time.


      - All the time?
      - Well, yeah, whenever.


      You know what? Here, come with me.


      - They're so cute.
      - Yeah.


      We adopt out <div class="mention">dog</div>s here,


      but we can't get anybody
      to take these guys.


      They're not puppies anymore,
      and everybody always wants puppies.


      Tell me about it.


      They're also kind of...
      Well, they're loveably defective.


      Cooper, he's my favorite.
      I think he's actually half goat.


      There's not a substance on Earth
      he can't chew through.


      He's been through pocketbooks,
      cell phones, shoes, handbags,


      even ate through a license plate once.


      This is Shep.


      Yeah, she's got some herding issues.


      - Pushy.
      - I like pushy.


      So, they've got quirks.
      I mean, they're still adorable.


      Good, I'm glad you think so,
      because you're taking them.


      What? No.


      The owner says
      we can't keep them forever


      and if I can't find a place to put them,
      then they're going to the pound.


      Look, I'm sorry,
      but there's no way that I can just...


      You're already taking care
      of a few strays, what's three more?


      - Three?
      - Oh, yeah. You're gonna love this guy.


      Romeo. Romeo. Romeo.


      Whoa.


      What if you just took them
      for a little while?


      Until I can figure something out.
      I'll pay for food.


      I get an employee discount.
      It's the least I can do.


      Georgia, I'm sorry, but I can't stand here
      all day playing fetch with you.


      Georgia, zip it.


      No.


      Guys, come on! Please! Oh, no!


      What's it gonna take for me
      to get you guys to...


      Sweet ride.


      Yeah, it's pretty much a chick magnet.
      I'm not gonna lie to you.


      Getting close. Right there. That's it.


      This is where you live?


      Actually, my parents are out of town,


      so I kind of had to make
      other arrangements.


      This place looks condemned.
      What are we doing here?


      It's where we keep the <div class="mention">dog</div>s.


      - Well, are you allowed to be in there?
      - No, so let's move it.


      All right, guys, watch this.


      Ready?


      Are you sure it's safe in here?


      Yeah. We've been poking around here
      for a couple of days, actually.


      Okay, that hurt.


      Hold your fire. Hold your fire.


      Bruce, you remember Dave, right?
      Dave from the pet store.


      Hi, Dave.


      He just needed a place
      to keep a couple of <div class="mention">dog</div>s


      and I thought, you know,
      "Hey, we have a place."


      So you made this?


      Yeah. It's a work in progress.


      And how did you learn
      how to make that?


      My dad.


      Wouldn't it be easier
      just to throw it, though?


      Yeah, but that's not really the point.
      The point is when I get it working,


      she should be able to play fetch
      even when we're not here.


      Can you give me free pay-per-view?


      Oh, poop!


      Literally!


      What is going on here?
      I mean, who poops on the floor?


      - Sorry. I need to work on that.
      - How did you find us?


      I followed the van
      with the ears and the tail.


      You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?


      Why would I tell?
      I'm gonna help you guys.


      - Really?
      - Yeah.


      I love <div class="mention">dog</div>s, and there's a lot more
      to taking care of them


      than throwing a stick and feeding them.


      You guys need me.


      I say she's in.


      Okay. I mean,
      how much trouble can they be?


      Come on, guys.


      Do you really think we can do this,
      like, every day?


      Yeah, why not? This is a piece of cake.


      - Guys, come back! Come back!
      - Guys, stop. Stop, stop, stop.


      Treat! Who wants a treat?


      Friday, no! Where is Romeo?


      Okay, Heather, you go that way,
      I'll go this way.


      Aren't we supposed
      to be wearing them out?


      This is totally normal.


      - Oh, so you think this is funny?
      - No, no, not at all.


      Actually, I was just about to thank you
      for reminding me to watch where I...


      ...step.


      You know, I think we might
      be in a little over our heads.


      It's 4-6, we're out<div class="mention">dog</div>ged.


      Guys, it's really not that bad.


      I mean, if you look at it,
      <div class="mention">dog</div>s have three basic needs.


      That's eating, sleeping
      and then peeing and pooping.


      - That's four.
      - No, I think peeing and pooping's one.


      I've stepped in both,
      and I'd have to disagree.


      Look, guys, I'm serious.
      I really think I can make this work.


      How?


      What do you think?


      Thanks.


      No, no, no, no. No.


      Ready?


      That's disgusting.


      That has to be the grossest thing
      I've ever seen.


      That's awesome.


      We just wandered in here.
      I'm not really sure what that thing was.


      Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.


      In fact, if you let me,
      I'd love to help you guys.


      I just work down the street, you know,
      I could keep an eye on the fuzz,


      could run interference,
      massage your shoulders.


      - Okay, easy there, tiger.
      - Yeah.


      Thanks for the offer,
      but I think we got it under control.


      Could I have a word with you?


      All right. I've got to be honest.


      I'm at a critical point
      in my social development


      and those are two fine-looking,
      hot women you have behind you,


      and let's face it,
      you can't date them both.


      So, who do you have dibs on?


      Dibs? I don't have dibs, per se.


      Gotcha.


      Name's Mark.


      Hi, Mark. You're on poop duty.


      Okay. So, how many <div class="mention">dog</div>s
      are we talking here?


      - Just six.
      - Seven.


      What is that?


      Actually, this is the newest member
      of our family.


      This is Henry.


      The poor guy was scrounging for food
      in the junkyard.


      - Bruce, that...
      - Andi.


      Honestly, we have enough room.
      We could take one more.


      One more? We can fit, like, 10 more.
      Think about that.


      Oh, yeah,
      why don't we just wander the streets


      and rescue every stray we see?


      That was funny.


      Dispatch to 22. We have a stray
      on Saint Andrews and Sixth.


      Saint Andrews and Sixth.


      Okay, guys, we've got a stray
      on Saint Andrews and Sixth.


      That's Saint Andrews and Sixth.


      It's right near the pound, so hurry.


      Hello? Hi. Sorry to bother you.


      We were wondering
      if we could have a minute of your time.


      - Not interested.
      - We work for the school newspaper


      and we would love an interview.


      All right. You know what?
      I don't have time for this.


      You guys just get out of here.
      Skedaddle and play somewhere else.


      Okay.


      What's the matter?


      Never seen a husky kid
      in a hoodie before?


      All right, guys,
      get over to the old railroad depot ASAP.


      Over there. That's them.


      - He's stuck.
      - Is she hurt?


      That's so sweet. They stayed together.
      You okay?


      You're safe now.
      We're gonna take care of you guys.


      Give me paw.


      There's that white one again.


      Let's get him.


      Here, <div class="mention">dog</div>gy. Here, <div class="mention">dog</div>gy.


      All right, come on, guys.
      You're being rescued.


      Here, <div class="mention">dog</div>.
      Hey, come back here, you mangy mutt.


      Hey! Come back here.


      All right, come on! Come on, everybody.


      Come on. Come on. Come on.


      - Head to tail. Head to tail. Come on.
      - Come on. Get across, guys.


      Go, go, go!


      Come on, trust it.
      You can do it. Come on. Come on.


      Good boy.


      Passengers loaded.


      - Heading back to base.
      - Copy that.


      - One, two, three, go!
      - Okay. Okay. Go!


      - Wait!
      - Oh, what's that?


      Hey, what is this? What's going on?


      - Thumb war.
      - Thumb war? Any calls?


      Nothing.


      Where are all the <div class="mention">dog</div>s?


      Thank you for riding the simulator.
      Please exit for the next customer.


      Out!


      Next.


      And please keep your paws
      inside the vehicle at all times.


      Come on. Come on. Come on.


      There's gotta be something
      you like to do.


      Go get her. Go get her.


      I'll get it.


      - Bernie.
      - Oh, hey, Bernie.


      Excellent. Bernie.


      Carl, Lois, I'm gonna borrow the kids
      for a second, is that okay?


      I don't know if you heard, but Lois and I
      got a gig this weekend. Paid.


      Wow. Really?


      I'm gonna RSVP you and the missus
      as a yes, right?


      I'm not sure that I'm actually gonna
      be able to make it.


      What about that friend of yours
      that owns the club?


      Oh, yeah, he's definitely gonna be there.


      Yeah? Excellent.


      - I told you.
      - Yeah.


      - So what is this emergency?
      - Who cares? At least we're out of there.


      They were about to start band practice.


      - Hey, what's up?
      - Hey, Jason.


      Hey, guys, I think I may have found
      the perfect foster parents for you.


      - Perfect?
      - They're perfect.


      They had two foster kids
      that just went off to college


      and they're looking for two more,


      and I think
      you guys are really gonna love them.


      So that's it, no more Carl and Lois.
      You guys get packed, you're out of here.


      Thank you, Bernie. Thank you.


      Best part about it is
      it's only three hours away.


      You guys are free.


      - What?
      - That far?


      Yes. What's the problem?


      - Well, we really like the area.
      - We've made a lot of great friends.


      Yeah, and you know, Carl and Lois'
      singing really grows on you.


      You hate Carl and Lois.


      Guys, what's going on?


      I mean, they want to make you
      a part of their family.


      Look, we appreciate
      everything you've done, but...


      Guys, you're not gonna get
      another chance like this.


      I really think you should go.


      We'd like to stay.


      Well, I...
      I have no idea what you guys are doing.


      We're really sorry.


      We're doing the right thing,
      aren't we, Friday?


      Hey. What's up, puppy.


      Is everything okay?


      Yeah, yeah, just... Just looking.


      - You come up here a lot, huh?
      - Yeah.


      I'm just guessing this is the kind of view
      I wouldn't be able to afford


      if this place were a real hotel.


      So, what are you doing tomorrow night?


      Sneaking out,
      serving 60 pounds of kibble,


      maybe mopping up some drool.


      'Cause a friend of mine
      is having this party


      and you could come and meet some
      people you'll be going to school with.


      The keyword here really being "people."


      Good point.


      Great. So, where should I pick you up?


      Why don't you just tell me where it is?
      I can meet you there.


      All right.


      That's dinner.


      - Hey, guys.
      - You guys ready for dinner?


      Are you hungry, buddy?


      Smells great.


      - Oh, thank you.
      - You're welcome.


      Thanks.


      - Thanks.
      - You're welcome.


      So, Heather,
      it's kind of like a dinner date, isn't it?


      To us. To a real family.


      - To us.
      - To us.


      - Cheers!
      - To us.


      Let's eat.


      If cartoon birds and mice were ever
      going to make me a dress for the ball,


      now would be a good time.


      - How long are you gonna be gone?
      - A few hours, maybe. It's just a party.


      What if anything goes wrong?


      Bruce, you can handle it.
      You can handle anything.


      I mean, have you stopped
      and looked around the hotel?


      I could disappear for a week


      and you'd be able
      to keep everything running.


      Yeah, but you're not gonna
      disappear for a week, right?


      Of course not.


      Now, if you could just build me a dress,
      then you'd be a real wizard.


      You should check out room 502.


      You look... Wow, you...
      You look gorgeous.


      What, this old thing?


      Here, come on in.
      Let me show you around.


      No! No, Lois!
      That's my personal, that's...


      - So what else have you stolen?
      - Nothing.


      - So you admit you did steal it.
      - Never said that, Lois.


      You might as well tell the truth.


      Do you really think
      you could outsmart us?


      I'd rather not answer that question, Carl.


      - I love your dress.
      - Thanks.


      Marianne, this is Andi.


      She's gonna be going to school
      with us next year.


      - Nice to meet you.
      - Andi.


      - Hey, Jason.
      - Hey.


      - How you doing?
      - All right.


      - You guys already know each other?
      - Yeah, it's Andi, right?


      Do I know you from somewhere?


      Yeah, you live in my grandmother's
      building with the Scudders.


      No, I'm over on Oak.
      I have one of those faces, though.


      No, you live with the Scudders.


      Come on, help me out here,
      I'm not crazy.


      They're your foster parents,
      you and your little brother... Barry.


      - Bruce?
      - Bruce, Bruce, Bruce. That's it, Bruce.


      Andi, what is he talking about?


      Oh, my God, you guys, it's no big deal.


      So I guess the Scudders have been
      foster parents before, big deal.


      They're also our aunt and uncle.


      We're just staying with them
      while our parents are traveling in China,


      and we just call them our parents
      because it is easier


      than talking about
      this whole long boring story, okay?


      I'm thirsty, anyone else?


      Anyone?


      Andi, I...


      Andi!


      - Did you get a hold of Bernie yet?
      - I'm on hold!


      Well, tell them it's an emergency.
      Tell them I'm being stolen from.


      Tell who? I'm on hold!


      Don't think this means that...


      You let him get away!


      Friday?


      - Hurry up!
      - I'm wearing heels!


      Well, so am I!


      - I can't believe they own a hotel.
      - Oh, God, Carl, you're such an idiot!


      Stay close to me, baby.


      What was that?


      Don't answer it.


      Hey, that's my wah-wah pedal.
      No wonder my sound's been off.


      Yeah, that's why.


      This crap is amazing.


      Yeah, 'cause it's our crap.
      They've been robbing us blind.


      Good girl. Drop it! Georgia, drop it!


      - Bruce, Bruce!
      - Let go. Georgia, let go of it!


      - Drop it, please!
      - Bruce!


      What happened?


      Don't ask.


      What happened with you?


      Oh, no!


      - Let's get out of here. Where's the exit?
      - Like I left bread crumbs.


      Quick, guys, go, go!


      - Put the lights back on!
      - I didn't do it!


      What is that?


      - I don't know. Let's get out of here!
      - Oh, God! Shut it!


      Are you sure they said
      it was coming from here?


      Don't know.


      Let's check upstairs.


      - Did you hear the cops?
      - I don't know.


      Oh, good.


      Well, if those were cops,


      we're gonna turn them in ourselves,
      'cause I smell reward.


      I don't think that's reward you smell.


      Where are we?


      We're in deep doo-doo.


      Okay. Stop breathing like that.


      No. No.


      - No.
      - Don't.


      Get them in there.


      No! What are you doing? Friday!
      You can't do this! No! Friday!


      - Bruce!
      - Friday!


      Friday! Let go of me! That's my <div class="mention">dog</div>!


      Bruce! Just go!


      It's okay.


      - Thanks.
      - You're welcome.


      - We're in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
      - Yeah.


      But Bernie's doing
      everything he can to help. Okay?


      Look, is there any way
      that they could just stay with you


      for a little while longer
      until I can find a family that'll take them?


      Not a chance. God knows
      how much they've stolen from us.


      We have a lot of very rare
      and valuable items in our home, okay?


      And we are gonna go
      and do a full inventory


      and we're letting you know, all right?
      This is an outrage. An outrage!


      I'm suing you. I'm suing those kids.
      I'm suing the state.


      I'm suing the guy
      that invented shrink wrap.


      I'm suing everyone!


      So you're gonna send us
      to that other house now, right?


      That nice couple?


      - Bruce...
      - Bruce, we're gonna be fine.


      I'll take care of it. Don't worry.


      Come on, Bernie.
      You have to help us, please.


      Bruce needs me.
      He's gonna get chewed up out there.


      Andi, I'm sorry, okay?
      There's nothing I can do about it.


      You can't separate us, okay?


      Don't punish him
      just because I screwed things up.


      Listen, the best thing you can do
      for Bruce right now


      is let him have a fresh start.


      I'm sorry.


      Can't I just say one thing to my sister?


      Look, Andi, don't worry about me, okay?
      I'm gonna be fine.


      I was supposed to keep us together.
      I was supposed to protect us.


      Andi, we had to protect the <div class="mention">dog</div>s.


      If I had to do it over again,
      I'd do the exact same thing.


      First come, first served!


      - Tomorrow morning for all of them.
      - Yep.


      - We're gonna be busy.
      - I can use the overtime.


      And which one are you?


      They must have left you behind.
      You're the lucky one.


      Come here, buddy.


      I know how to sit,
      how to fetch and how to roll over.


      What I don't know
      is how I ended up in here.


      Could you please turn that off?


      - Please.
      - I did turn it off.


      Hey!


      - You busy?
      - Friday!


      Oh, good boy. Good boy.


      So what's the plan?


      The <div class="mention">dog</div>s have less than a day left.
      We've got to get them out of there now.


      Okay, that's really
      more a goal than a plan.


      There's a no-kill shelter
      outside the city,


      so if we can get them out of the pound
      and over the county line,


      then they're home free.


      - Right.
      - But we gotta move quick.


      Andi, what happens to us?


      It's...


      Look, Bruce, it's not gonna be good.


      We're gonna be in more trouble
      than we've ever been in.


      But we're gonna save the <div class="mention">dog</div>s.


      It's what we're supposed to do, right?


      Okay, guys.


      Okay, so here's the pound,
      and this is the county line,


      and this is what we're gonna do.


      Are we ready?


      Let's do this!


      Got sausage.


      Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello?


      When a young girl is screaming for help
      and yelling, "Fire,"


      - you're supposed to get moving!
      - I have water.


      Fire! Hello?


      - Where?
      - And they say chivalry is dead.


      It's right over there.


      Hey!


      A bunch of kids eager to adopt, I bet.


      - Where are the keys?
      - There!


      You didn't think we'd forget you,
      did you?


      Come on! Let's go. Come on.


      I missed you guys, too.
      Come on. Let's go! Come on!


      Let's go, Shep! Come on, let's go!


      - Let's go for a run, you guys, come on!
      - Go, go, go!


      Checking out.


      We're gonna get you guys out of here.
      Come on.


      Hurry up, Thor, gotta go!


      Let's go, let's go!


      Way to go, Shep! Good girl.


      Okay, the coast is clear.
      Bring her on back.


      What's going on here?


      I know you. All right, let's go.
      You're going to jail.


      Trouble! Trouble!


      We can do this hard or we can do it
      easy. Let's go, missy. Come on.


      Keep your paws off of her.


      Heather, save yourself!
      Save yourself! Go! I have him!


      Nobody's going anywhere.


      Get back in there.


      Keys.


      Hey!


      Okay, Friday,
      you're gonna lead the pack.


      - Mark!
      - Yes?


      Thank you!


      Come on, Friday. A little faster, buddy!
      You can do it!


      Follow the sausage, Friday.
      Follow the sausage!


      - Well, that went well.
      - Yeah, well, we're not done yet.


      Come on, Friday, lead your pack!
      Good boy!


      Come on, guys, follow the meat!
      Come on! That's it, Friday, let's go.


      Oh, that's not good.


      Hey!


      - You guys, are we there yet?
      - We're almost there, just up ahead.


      Wait. What? Oh, no!


      Friday!


      Guys, come back! This way!
      Problem. They just went the other way.


      What?


      Where are they going?


      Home. They're going home.


      Block the exits.
      Make sure they don't get back out.


      Let's get some more
      Animal Control out here.


      - How much?
      - All of it.


      We need all available Animal Control
      units. All available Animal Control units.


      It is pure bedlam down here


      as authorities try
      to take control of the situation.


      This scheme was supposedly
      the work of several juvenile delinquents.


      Upstairs, right now, let's go!


      There's no need to get upset, Officer.
      Animal Control is on the scene.


      All right, everybody,
      if you can just let us do our job,


      we'll have all these
      dangerous canines rounded up


      and out of your hair presently.


      - Stop!
      - Can I get through here?


      - Watch out. Please?
      - Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.


      Oh, no, no, no, no! Not you again!


      - Those <div class="mention">dog</div>s belong to us.
      - They're family.


      Yeah, we're not gonna let you
      coverall-wearing goons


      take them away from us.
      And you can put that in your report.


      Officer, would you please arrest
      these young felons right now


      - so we can get back to work?
      - Fine! Just leave the <div class="mention">dog</div>s alone!


      Andi! There he is!


      That's our <div class="mention">dog</div>!
      You can't just take him away!


      - Oh, what do we got here? A puppy!
      - Just leave my <div class="mention">dog</div> alone!


      Stop!


      - Okay. Now, who are you?
      - I'm Bernie Wilkins.


      Social Services.


      Okay, get them out of here!


      Come on, listen.
      Can you just hear me out


      before you throw these kids in jail
      and destroy all these innocent <div class="mention">dog</div>s?


      I see no reason
      why we can't hear both sides.


      Look. I'm responsible for these kids,
      and I know what they did was wrong.


      But I gotta tell you,
      I wish I had the guts to do what they did.


      I've been trying to place kids
      in good homes for 15 years


      and most of the time,
      I'm not successful.


      But these kids,
      they didn't make excuses.


      They didn't get frustrated
      with the system and give up.


      They just went out and did it.
      They saved everybody.


      They created their own little family.


      You call this a family? A bunch
      of mangy strays in an old hotel?


      "Madison."


      Madison.


      Madison.


      "August 3rd,


      "found hiding in a backyard after the
      family moved away and left her behind."


      Viola and Sebastian, the twins.


      "Together since they were puppies.


      "Viola got snagged on a fence,


      "but Sebastian refused
      to leave his sister behind."


      "Chelsea.


      "Chelsea lost her leg in an accident.


      "The owner didn't pay the bill
      and abandoned her at the vet."


      "Coco, Rocky and Harley.


      "Found living together
      in the woods near a dump."


      And there's many more.


      "Ginger.


      "Henry, Romeo, Juliet.


      "Cooper.


      "Shep.


      "George"? Does that say "George"?


      Georgia! Her name's Georgia.


      And Lenny.


      Georgia and Lenny.


      They're the first two residents
      in this hotel.


      The Hotel for <div class="mention">dog</div>s.


      No one was turned away
      when they needed a home.


      Nobody was abandoned
      when they were looking for a family.


      Are you really gonna tell me that
      we're gonna just abandon them now?


      They don't look like
      mangy strays, Officer.


      But you don't mind
      if we take a look upstairs, do you?


      I think it's in the public's best interest.


      Be my guest.


      - You did great.
      - You don't think I was too pushy?


      I like pushy.
      - Mark?
      - Heather.
      So, is this when the hero gets the girl?
      Baby steps.
      Do you mind if I...
      No. Okay, sorry.
      You kids are heroes.
      You should be proud.
      - Thank you.
      - Thanks.
      Yeah, but the bad news is, in all this,
      I still haven't been able to find a foster
      family that's willing to take you guys.
      That's okay, Bernie,
      we know you tried your best.
      But the good news is,
      I have found some real parents
      that might be willing to adopt.
      - Adopt?
      - Yeah.
      See, the mom is excellent.
      She's a teacher,
      so she's really great with kids.
      And he cannot cook to save his life.
      And he shouts during football games
      like the players can actually hear him.
      But he has a great heart.
      Wait a minute.
      Do they like <div class="mention">dog</div>s?
      We love <div class="mention">dog</div>s.
      Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
      I'd like to welcome you
      to the Hotel for <div class="mention">dog</div>s.
      Thanks to the generosity
      of the entire city,
      we are now able to take care
      of all your canine needs.
      Thank you, Georgia.
      Room 320 is now available.
      I'm sorry, Georgia, I forgot your tip.
      Good girl. Thanks, Georgia.
      Whether you are here to board or adopt,
      please note we are a green hotel.

<div class="box6"></div>
<div class="box7">
        Here we are, folks,
      on the red carpet at the grand opening...



      ... of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.



      Tonight's premiere exhibit
      is a rousing look back...



      ... at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.



      And here they are.



      Folks, this crowd is going crazy
      over Mystery Inc.



      Here you go, girls.



      I got an ascot for each of you.



      Hello!



      Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake
      and the whole city's shaking!



      Yeah!



      Come on, Scoob.



      Sorry.



      I consider it a privilege, sir.



      - Daphne!
      - Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.



      Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!



      Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed
      on our chests! Look!



      That's very sweet.



      Velma! Velma!



      - Sign it, please.
      - We love you, Velma.



      Thanks.



      - I love her so much.
      - May I have a word...



      ...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
      - Absolutely.



      That's your word.
      Come on, dear. We're late.



      Heather Jasper-Howe
      at the grand opening...



      ...of the new Coolsonian
      Criminology Museum...



      ...with our guests of honor, the master
      detectives of Mystery Incorporated.



      Shaggy!



      Right on!



      Hello! Hello!



      With all your success, will you still
      have time for us in little old Coolsville?



      Of course little old Coolsville
      can solve its problems without us...



      ...but we'll always be here to help.



      The people of Coolsville
      are the best in the world!



      - Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
      - Absolutely.



      Mystery Inc. Is proud to donate the
      costumes of criminals we've unmasked.



      - Like The Black Knight Ghost.
      - Our very first case.



      The       Volt Ghost.



      The Skeleton Men,
      and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.



      We've also donated the costumes
      of some of our more ridiculous foes.



      Like Chickenstein.



      Can we get a shot of you
      next to The Black Night?



      Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot
      that dude tried to pluck us.



      - Remember what I told you?
      - Never pick your nose in public?



      No, but that's good too.



      - Image is everything.
      - Yes! Lmage is everything.



      The whole city's watching,
      so try and keep a brave face.



      - They're costumes.
      - Right.



      She's right, Scoob.
      Up close, they look totally fake.



      The Tar Monster scared the locals
      of Byzantius away to take their treasure.



      But on the positive side,
      he'd pave your driveway for free.



      Isn't that right, Velma?



      Velma?



      - Hi.
      - Hi.



      Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.



      He's the curator here at the museum.



      It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.



      I hope you'll be working closely with
      Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.



      I know that you're a glamorous,
      mysterious, jet-set adventurer...



      ...preoccupied with
      international intrigue and all...



      - Yes. That's me.
      - I know, but...



      There's a symposium coming up on
      syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain...



      I have always found
      a criminal's inclination...



      ...to incorrectly use the interrogative
      pronoun in place of the relative...



      ...delightfully absurd.



      - Me too!
      - Really?



      So maybe you'd want to go together?



      Suppose you mean like...



      Like a...



      Like a date. With me.



      No, I can't, Patrick.



      Mystery is my mistress.
      I must heed her sweet call.



      Okay.



      What's happening?



      Oh, boy.



      Daphne!



      Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!



      - We need to come up with a plan.
      - Hiding is our plan.



      In case you haven't noticed, there's
      an unidentified freaky object in here!



      - The curtains!
      - We're on them!



      - Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
      - But chickens aren't good with ropes!



      - We got him!
      - Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!



      It's just a costume!
      It's just a costume!



      It's just a costume!



      We tied it! Let go!



      Sorry!



      - We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
      - As usual!



      Fire!



      Mystery Incorporated.



      This is only the first rung
      on the ladder of your demise.



      Look out!



      And this time,
      you'll be the ones unmasked...



      ...as the buffoons you truly are!



      Any clues to the cause of the attack? How
      did the dinosaur get through security?



      Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?



      A secret hatch!



      The real Pterodactyl Ghost
      must have come through here!



      A reptilian scale.



      A most wonderful clue.



      He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
      Ghost and The       Volt Ghost. Why?



      Fred, Daphne. Could you answer
      a few questions for the press?



      Fred, I don't think
      that's a really good idea.



      We always face the press
      after we've unmasked the creeps.



      We looked ridiculous back there.



      Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
      The press loves us.



      The higher the pedestal,
      the harder the fall.



      And Mystery Inc. Fell far
      in the embarrassing debacle...



      ... that tarnished the reputation
      of the once-great gang.



      It was an utter disaster
      as two of the gang's key members...



      ... Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
      and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...



      ... caused untold damage to Coolsville's
      hottest new tourist attraction...



      ... which took a full two years to complete.



      When asked for comment, Fred Jones,
      leader of Mystery Inc., said this:



      Coolsville can solve its
      problems without us.



      I didn't say that! I mean...



      I did, but that's out of context!



      This is Heather Jasper-Howe,
      disillusioned from Coolsville.



      It's all my fault.



      I'm the one who told Shaggy
      and Scooby to get the ropes.



      No, Velma, it's my fault.



      I should have checked
      that they were tied before I let go.



      It's my fault too.



      We all know how Shaggy
      and Scooby can be.



      But it's all right.



      We just need to stay strong,
      in control, and work fast.



      Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.



      We'll figure a way out
      of this Jurassic jumble.



      Shaggy?



      - We're screwups.
      - Yeah.



      I guess, looking back, every time they
      made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.



      - I just never noticed before.
      - Me neither.



      There's gotta be some way we can prove
      that we actually belong in the gang.



      We've gotta do something
      totally unlike us.



      You know, Scoob...



      ...we could act like real detectives!



      Really?



      Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
      No, your right paw. Your other paw.



      Repeat after me. From this day forward
      we will no longer be our goofy selves.



      We will be awesome detectives.



      And we will act more like Fred
      and Velma and Daphne.



      We will be terrific and fantastic
      and spectacular...



      ...and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
      "lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular. "



      Suck-tacular.



      Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.



      Let's kick this investigation up to an   !



      What the heck are you guys doing?



      We figured the first step
      in solving a mystery...



      ...would be to wear the right attire.



      I'm sorry, Daph,
      but your go-go boots didn't fit...



      ...me!



      Scooby! Those so don't go
      with that sweater!



      Really?



      Clues!



      Alas, what are these strange markings?



      Words.



      Words!



      Scooby-Doo, take notes.



      - Gotcha.
      - Come on, you kooks.



      Okay.



      It's come back positive.



      This is a real pterodactyl scale.



      Precisely!



      That masked figure
      was out to humiliate us.



      Maybe it's someone we unmasked.



      But who would be able to make
      a real Pterodactyl Ghost?



      The original Pterodactyl Ghost.



      Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.



      That's right!



      Jacobo wreaked havoc
      in a statewide crime spree.



      Jacobo stole millions...



      ... which he used to finance his failed
      experiments trying to create monsters.



      Come alive! Come alive!



      You think Jacobo 's behind this?



      Impossible. Three years ago
      he attempted a prison escape.



      So long, suckers!



      Help me, suckers!



      His body was lost at sea.



      How about this? Jacobo's cellmate
      was released from prison two months ago.



      Jeremiah Wickles.



      The Black Knight Ghost. That was
      one of the costumes that was stolen.



      Right! And...



      Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?



      Bunny.



      It seems Old Man Wickles
      deserves a visit...



      ... before any of our other creepy
      conquests make a comeback.



      Freddy, up on the right.



      Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.



      Oh, man. Another creepy crib!



      How come we can't ever investigate,
      like, a KFC or something?



      Shaggy!



      All right. Then again,
      creepy is my middle name.



      Scoob!



      Come on, Scoob!



      Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.



      Nice job last night. Losers!



      Quick, we need to think of a comeback.



      What dorks.



      Hey! Shut up!



      That's a good one.



      You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.



      - Leave now or pay the price.
      - What jerk makes that his doorbell?



      Dude.



      He just said we'd pay the price.



      Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.



      What could possibly happen
      by ringing a doorbell?



      Help me!



      Shaggy!



      I think I pulled something.



      That's what can happen
      by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!



      At   p.m., the owner
      will be home to set you free.



      You want to buy a box of cookies?



      Excuse me.
      Have you heard the Good News?



      Yeah. There's cookies!



      Watch the junk!



      Sorry.



      Oh, brother.
      The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.



      - Let me just get to my makeup.
      - Daph, now?



      You know what, Velma? It's never too late
      to learn to properly apply makeup.



      Okay. The last good thumbprint
      should still be there, so...



      ...a little blush...



      ...a pore strip...



      ...and voilà.



      All right, Daph!



      I enjoy being a girl.



      - Thank you!
      - See if I can get my mechanic's job back.



      - Twenty,      ...
      - Thanks for the cookies.



      ...  ... Welcome!
      Sixty,      ...



      Okay, gang. Let's, like,
      split up and search for clues.



      Scoob and I will go this way.
      Come on, Scoob.



      He stole my thing that I say!



      Search for clues. Search for clues.



      A clue!



      Shiny footprints.



      The glow is similar
      to the pterodactyl scale.



      A clue!



      It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's
      fascination with the supernatural.



      He collects everything
      from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.



      He collects dust too.



      No. The dust is good.
      We can tell what he's been reading lately.



      Like here!



      What is it?



      It's an obsolete Celtic text used by
      secret societies in the mid-  th century.



      Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.



      The original Pterodactyl Ghost.



      Maybe he gave it to Wickles
      before he died.



      Can you read it?



      It's an amalgamation
      of magic and science.



      Here's a list of ingredients...



      ...on how to create
      your own carbon-based...



      ...organic, composite predators.



      This is an instruction manual
      on how to create monsters.



      Scoob.



      Clues!



      Those aren't clues, Scoob.
      Those are just things you want.



      Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?



      Just because you can sing in it doesn't
      make it a clue. It makes it awesome.



      Like, what's this?



      "The Faux Ghost. "



      We're in luck.
      It's tonight, Scoob!



      - We are detectives.
      - Really?



      You found an actual clue!



      I found a clue!



      Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!



      We're going back, we're going back!



      Black Knight Ghost!



      Run, Shaggy!



      Let's go.



      Like, lock the door!



      Heavy stuff, Scoob!



      Give me a hand, Scoob!



      See him get through this!



      Heavy!



      We outsmarted that moron!



      Yeah! What a moron.



      Look at me.



      - Thanks.
      - You're welcome.



      - Yo, metalhead!
      - Yes?



      Bring it.



      He brought it.



      Daphne! Hold him off!



      I'll look in the book.



      Maybe there's a formula
      for finding his weakness.



      Here. "To find a creature's
      weakest point...



      ...take the angle between
      the current position of the sun...



      ...and your geographical point..."
      - Velma!



      "Add this point,    and a half feet up
      from sea level. "



      That tickles.



      This is bad.



      "Multiply this number..."



      "Add the square inches of..."



      Velma!



      "... the square root... "



      Now it's good night, ladies!



      "... your X-axis. "



      "And subtract     . That's your Y-axis. "



      Look. No hands!



      Any time would be great, Velma!



      I'm trying.



      "Subtract one, divide by B,
      follow upward eight degrees north. "



      Which makes his weakest point right here!



      Right in the roundtables.



      Run!



      In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!



      Come on, Scoob! Inside!



      I'll compare the glow of those footprints
      to the pterodactyl scale.



      We'll check out Wickles' book.



      Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome
      clue. But what do we do with it?



      Let's solve the mystery.



      If we solve the mystery by ourselves...



      ...it would certainly prove to the gang
      that we belong.



      Let's head to The Faux Ghost...



      ...find Wickles, and see what he knows.



      But first, let's give the gang
      the old "slipperooney. "



      Hey, guys.



      Scooby's feeling kind of...



      ...like he's got rabies.



      We're just gonna go outside
      to get some fresh air.



      Jinkies!



      What's up, Velms?



      The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.



      It contains randamonium,
      which this books says...



      ...is the critical ingredient
      needed to make monsters.



      Doesn't randamonium glow,
      like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?



      If we prove Wickles is behind this,
      this mystery goes down like a dot-com...



      ...and Coolsville digs us again.
      - Where would he get randamonium?



      Randamonium is the byproduct
      of silver mines.



      Like the abandoned mining town
      in old Coolsville.



      Then we better get to that mining town
      and see what's...



      I'm invisible. I'm invisible.



      Get rid of him!



      Keep him busy.



      What are you doing?



      He wants to ask me on a date.



      It's okay to be scared.



      I am not scared.
      I've fought werewolves and ghosts.



      But in the end, we usually unmask them
      and it's a little scared man inside.



      It's the same with dating.



      Velma, have you ever considered
      that maybe werewolves and ghosts...



      ...are just distractions to keep you away
      from what really frightens you?



      Intimacy with another person.



      And by intimacy, I mean someone
      who thinks you're really hot.



      But I'm more comfortable
      in the world of logic and facts.



      And...



      ...I'm not hot.



      Me neither.



      Everybody has flaws, Velma.
      The object of a healthy relationship...



      ...is to never let the other person
      know they're there.



      - To museums.
      - To museums.



      Daph, I really like this guy.



      What would you do if someone thought...



      ...that you were some glamorous
      and mysterious jet-setter?



      I'd make myself one.



      Who's your mommy?



      My mommy?



      Come on, let's solve a mystery.



      - Do you have to go to the bathroom?
      - No, I can't in this outfit.



      Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.



      Here we go.



      That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.



      Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.



      Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
      He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.



      And that's Aggie Wilkins,
      a.k.a. The Ozark Witch.



      These are all folks we unmasked.



      If they spot us,
      they'll invite us to a weenie roast.



      One where we're the weenies!



      Hot <div class="mention">dog</div>s!



      There's gotta be some way that we can
      use our awesome, fearless new skills...



      ...to get us in there
      without being recognized.



      Everyone part like the Red Sea.



      It's me, Shizzy McCreepy,
      and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.



      We are in the house and ready to party.



      Hey, handsome.



      Hello, baby.



      - Zoinks!
      - Jinkies!



      - Hey, gang.
      - Jinkies!



      - Hey!
      - Yipe!



      A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier
      than a Cotton Candy Glob!



      Watch out, idiot.



      - Old Man Wickles!
      - Leave me alone.



      No!



      I just wanted to say thank you.



      Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost
      was inspirational to my brother and me.



      Have you done anything cool
      and creepy lately?



      Listen, I'm not normally one
      for giving advice...



      ...but I feel sorry for you because
      of your brother's hideous nose deformity.



      Get out of this game
      while you got a chance.



      All of us here ain't nothing to admire.



      We needed people to believe
      we were different than we were.



      Maybe because we believed...



      ...that there was something wrong
      with who we were in the first place.



      I guess you're sort of grateful
      to Mystery Inc...



      ...for unmasking you.
      - Are you kidding?



      If I see those twerps,
      I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.



      Make them eat the one eye while watching
      themselves eat it with the other eye!



      Bye.



      Here's a clue for you.
      That dude's wearing his freak hat   / .



      I gotta take a whiz.
      Don't do anything to attract attention.



      Gotcha.



      Hey, doll.



      You wanna dance?



      Groovy.



      Here we go.



      Shake it, baby.



      Give me five!



      Oh, yeah!



      Everybody!



      Oh, yeah.



      Hey, Shaggy!



      It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt
      what helped throw us in jail!



      Who, me?



      No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!



      That's S.D. McCrawley.
      He's just wearing a mask.



      And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
      Shaggy Rogers.



      - Where?
      - There.



      Zoinks! Gangway!



      Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!



      And stay out!



      That wasn't so bad, Scoob.



      That was my outfit, I swear.



      You know, Velma,
      you are as beautiful as ever.



      You're just so different than I expected.



      You know, I'm just...



      - Oh, my goodness!
      - What the heck's going on?



      This cannot be good.



      My museum.



      Wait!



      Any comments on the museum robbery?



      Mystery Inc. Is investigating
      the two stolen costumes.



      No, the one that just happened.



      Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
      Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?



      The rest of the costumes?



      So, what you're saying is
      it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.



      No! You're doing that thing again where
      you take everything I say out of context.



      You're trying to make it look
      like I think Coolsville sucks.



      No! Don't record that!



      Patrick, I'm so sorry.
      It must be so hard for you.



      I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?



      - I'll go with you...
      - No! Just...



      No, I have to figure out what's going on.



      All Fred Jones had to say was:



      I think Coolsville sucks!



      In light of the city's recent chaos...



      ... Jones ' response was disheartening
      to the fans who have supported them.



      Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving
      gang to shape up or ship out.



      I'll be right back.



      This is Heather Jasper-Howe
      for Investigative Probe Reporting.



      What's with the personal attacks?



      Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor...



      Who are you kidding?



      Who are you kidding?



      Don't think I don't know your game.



      What do you do for the gang?



      Really?



      Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.



      All you are is a pretty little face.



      Why are you doing this?



      Because it's my job to unmask
      those who pretend to be who they're not.



      "Unmask those"? You sound like...



      Sound like who?



      The evil masked guy.



      But you know that, because
      just as you know I'm standing here...



      ...you know I know
      who you know you are...



      ...which is him, who's a her,
      which is you.



      Now I see what you do for the gang.



      You're in charge of incoherent babbling.



      Mystery Incorporated.



      Once again, you are proven useless
      before my power.



      Because of you, soon Coolsville...



      ...will be mine.



      Darn it.



      Thanks a lot!
      The scoop of the night, gone.



      Can't you do anything right?



      Ned, get your camera and follow me.



      Guess not.



      Stop wasting my time!



      You hear me? Now I want you to question
      all your scum-bucket friends.



      Find out what they know
      about those stolen costumes.



      Or else you'll be known
      as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!



      I want answers. Now, go! Now!



      Yes, sir!



      - Sorry.
      - It's okay.



      Patrick.



      Shaggy. Scooby.



      What are you guys doing here?



      We just came down here
      to be undercover and stuff.



      Me too.



      My museum got broken into again...



      ...so I had to come here
      and try and get some answers.



      Gotta put on the tough-guy act,
      or these guys will eat me alive.



      What's the matter, you don't believe me?



      I'm kidding!



      - It's the tough-guy act.
      - That's good.



      I got you.



      That was a joke? That was good!



      You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.



      It needs work.



      Look, Patrick...



      ...we could stay here, do this all night,
      and something tells me you would...



      ...but we gotta make
      like your personality and split.



      Okay.



      Scooby-Doo. Scoob!



      Hello?



      Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?



      Hello, Shaggy.



      Wickles has led us
      into a terrifying ghost town!



      - Ghost town?
      - Yes, a ghost town!



      Darn bushes yowling at me again.



      - Keep quiet, Scoob.
      - Okay, Shaggy.



      Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
      Through here, Scoob?



      I don't know.



      Oh, boy.



      Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!



      Elevator.



      Good work, pal!



      Like, let's skedaddle.



      So, what's your assessment, Velmster?



      This place seems harmless enough.



      I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure
      could've gotten his randamonium...



      ...from here at the mine?
      - Oh, sorry.



      I was just thinking about Patrick.



      He seemed so upset when he left.



      - Right. So...
      - And...



      ...he doesn't like me.



      Okay. So your assessment is?



      - Love stinks.
      - Fred?



      Do you think I'm just a pretty face?



      No.



      I mean, yes.



      I mean, not fat!



      Definitely not fat.
      Is this sort of what you're looking for?



      Fat? Why would you even use that word?



      Never again will they underestimate us.
      That's right.



      I've gathered you here today
      for something big.



      At last.



      All these years of careful planning...



      ...have culminated
      in this one glorious moment.



      Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed
      in your foul monster-making scheme.



      With your ugly, evil henchmen.



      Henchmen?



      Young man, we're investors,
      and we're listening to his pitch.



      So as I was saying...



      ...the Old Tyme Mining Town,
      a summer camp for kids...



      ...where they can have
      an authentic mining experience.



      They can dig for    hours straight,
      just like in the golden days of yore.



      They have the time of their lives,
      and we get free miners!



      Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...



      ...your ties to recent monster attacks.
      - I don't know nothing about no monsters.



      Then how come there was randamonium
      on the floor of your mansion?



      There's randamonium all over the place.
      I come home with it in my shorts.



      Are you continuing the work
      of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?



      Old pal? Jacobo?



      We hated each other.



      In the prison cafeteria,
      he used to steal my Tater Tots!



      And he got the lead in My Fair Lady.



      Then why did we find the monster book
      in your library?



      Wait a second. You're the runts
      what vandalized my home.



      Which one of you stole my toilet brush?



      Gentlemen.



      - I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
      - What happened? I haven't finished!



      Wait, fellas!



      Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
      I think we're onto something.



      It's like a huge laboratory.



      - Go ahead.
      - Okay.



      This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.



      Refrigerator!



      Lemonade!



      Check it out.
      Look at those weird letters, Scoob.



      Shaggy?



      Scooby-Doo,
      you turned into a freaky monster.



      You don't eat stuff that glows.



      There's got to be an antidote
      in here somewhere.



      Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.



      Tastes like...



      Strawberries.



      I'm okay, Scoob.



      I've got a chick's body!



      I'm the Tasmanian Devil!



      Check it out, dude!



      I'm buff.



      My God.



      It seems as if I've become
      ludicrously intelligent.



      It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance
      of my former self.



      Chasing cats, licking my own rear end,
      eating my own vomit.



      Those were wonderful times.



      Check out my pecs, little man!



      Hush now, buffoon.
      This is a highly combustible synthesis.



      A what?



      I'm going to transform us back!



      No way, geek!



      I'm gonna stay this way forever!



      No!



      Let's go!



      Careful, gang.



      This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf
      almost destroyed us.



      Go boom.



      You are embarrassing.



      That was almost exactly like
      my freshman year in college.



      What are you guys doing here?
      You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.



      I invented a potion.



      You lied to us. We're a team.



      You don't just go off half-cocked
      doing whatever you want.



      Hey, gang.



      "Beware who enters the Monster Hive.



      Inside your fears will come alive. "



      Oh, my.



      Look! It's the costumes
      from the museum!



      - Zombie.
      - Miner   er.



      - Captain Cutler.
      - I bet they're all here.



      He must have used the costumes
      to make real monsters, which implies...



      He needs the costumes to make
      the monsters, which implies...



      He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost
      costume somehow, which implies...



      Patrick's the one.



      Velma's in love.



      No, I mean the one.



      The bad guy.



      That's why he wanted to go out with me.



      To see what we knew.



      We just saw Patrick
      at the bad guys' hangout.



      He was working both sides
      of Psycho Street.



      I don't know who's behind this,
      but we don't need him...



      ...transforming more costumes.



      Let's find a way to shut down
      this monster-maker for good.



      Guys? What's over here?



      This light is strange.



      Scooby-Doo.



      We're the ones that found this place.
      Score one for the big guys!



      Now we need to keep acting
      like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.



      Like, wowee.



      Cool! Like, "tuneage. "



      Like, what's that weird sound?



      Captain Cutler!



      Miner   er!



      The Tar Monster!



      We have...



      ...to remain...



      ...calm.



      Calm, Scooby-Doo!
      You're not being calm!



      I needed that.
      I needed that too.



      You're pushing your luck, Scoob!



      You girls find anything?



      - He did it.
      - Scoob!



      Fred, disconnect that control panel!



      Maybe it'll stop the machine!



      Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!



      - Like, The       Volt Ghost!
      - Come on, Scoob!



      We're gonna die!



      - Think positive!
      - We're gonna die quickly!



      Wait for me!



      Come on, girls!



      - An exit!
      - Run, Shaggy!



      Stop them!



      Destroy the city if you have to,
      but get me that control panel!



      With it, they can destroy everything
      I've set out to do.



      Hurry up, gang.
      We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.



      End of the line, Mystery Inc.!



      Die!



      Let's book, Scoob.



      Oh, boy.



      Let's rip it, Scoob!



      Zoinks!



      I don't know.



      Banzai!



      We're getting rad!



      Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
      Zoinks!



      Hello.



      Scooby!



      Are you guys okay?



      Sure. As long as you define "okay"
      as "in massive agony. "



      We should get back to headquarters.



      No! That'll be the first place
      they'll look for us.



      I think I know where to go.



      Move that worthless piece of tin!



      Unlike some of you,
      I have a very important meeting!



      Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.



      Your reward: We'll let you live.



      My monsters can make life
      very unpleasant.



      Find me Mystery Inc., now.



      Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency
      update for Investigative Probe.



      A monster army has invaded Coolsville.



      Angry citizens have gathered
      outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.



      They're insisting the gang cooperate
      with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.



      Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!



      Excuse me, sir.
      Do you have anything to say for yourself?



      I beg you, Mystery Inc.



      If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.



      If we do, he'll get the control panel back,
      and the city will be in worse shape.



      We'd be playing right into his hands.



      Please. For our city's sake.



      Sorry. You're cancelled.



      The old high-school clubhouse.



      We should be safe here.



      We haven't been here in years.



      Freddy, are you okay?



      - Do you wanna talk?
      - Talking's for wimps.



      It's time for action.



      You know, Scoob...



      ...this Evil Masked Figure
      is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.



      And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.



      Like, this is the most "our-faultiest"
      screwup ever, Scoob.



      Still works.



      Look, all my old tools.



      After all our so-called success...



      ...we're back in this old firetrap.



      Hit me, Fred.



      Good throw, Velm!



      - Mine.
      - Gotcha!



      Throw it to me!



      - Go long!
      - Okay.



      Go, Scooby-Doo!



      Dude!



      It all seemed so easy back then.



      We solved mysteries for the love of them,
      not to prove anything to anyone.



      And the mysteries all seemed
      to unravel themselves.



      Sometimes, the answers
      would just appear like magic.



      My first multiple-resonance
      imaging device.



      Made out of a crystal radio
      and old video games.



      Wait a minute.



      Randamonium has an algorithmic
      cross-currency of negative  .    .



      With it, maybe...
      Well, just maybe...



      We could reverse the current
      and reverse the monster-making process!



      All we need to do
      is rewire the control panel...



      Bring it back to the Monster Hive
      and plug it into the base.



      - Push the button...
      - And instead of creating monsters...



      ...all the monsters will be destroyed.



      Like, they're totally having
      a montage in there without us.



      I'll tell you one thing for sure.
      They don't need our help to figure it out.



      We're screwups.



      The only time we do anything right...



      ...is when we accidentally plow
      into the Snow Ghost...



      ...because we've accidentally glued our
      feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.



      Eight stupid times.



      Face it, Scoob.



      We'll never be anything
      but our old goofy selves.



      I wish once...



      ...just once...



      ...I could do the right thing on purpose.



      You know, Scoob?



      Like, be a hero...



      ...and save the day.



      But who are we kidding, right?



      Captain Cutler's Ghost.



      Captain Cutler's Ghost!



      They found us. Finish that in the van
      when we get to the Monster Hive.



      - Come on, guys! In the van!
      - Hurry!



      Go, Fred! Hit it!



      - What do we do?
      - What do we do?



      Fine. Let's go back!



      That's the wrong way!



      Shaggy! Give me a hand.



      This is tied for
      the most terrifying day of my life.



      - Tied with what?
      - Every other freaking day of my life!



      It's done!



      Jinkies! Tweety's back.



      - Shaggy!
      - Yeah?



      I'm putting her in cruise.
      Take the wheel.



      Go!



      Take this!



      - This is bad.
      - No doubt.



      - Shaggy?
      - Yeah.



      Who's driving?



      Hello.



      - Scoob.
      - What?



      - Turn the wheel!
      - Wheel?



      - Turn the wheel!
      - The round thing, Scoob!



      - Scooby!
      - Okay.



      I'm driving!



      Watch out, Scoob!



      You did it, Scoob!



      All right, gang.
      The Monster Hive is right over there.



      Let's get this control panel
      and plug her in.



      You go nowhere, knave.



      You guys take the long way around.



      And I'll hold him off.



      - Come on.
      - Go get him, Fred.



      - Come on, Daph!
      - I'm coming!



      Not so fast!



      You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
      Just get that control panel to the Hive.



      - Go!
      - We've got it, Daph!



      Scary.



      Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.



      Daph?



      - Daph, are you okay?
      - I think so.



      Guess this is it, huh?



      Oh, baby.



      I'm afraid.



      What a wimp, huh?



      That doesn't make you a wimp.



      Makes you human.



      The Skeleton Men.



      - He does that when he gets nervous.
      - Sorry.



      - Here, Shaggy, take this.
      - Why are you giving this to me?



      I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.



      - Get this to the Monster Hive.
      - Us?



      You're faster than me.



      Once there, just plug it into the base.
      Push this button.



      I fixed it so it will destroy
      all the monsters.



      But...



      ...we can't.
      - We're screwups.



      We tried to be heroes like you guys,
      but we're not.



      - We're just not.
      - No.



      Like me?



      That's funny.
      I always wanted to be like you guys.



      You guys are so free. You're never afraid
      to be who you really are.



      Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.



      I think you've been heroes all along.



      You just haven't known it.



      Here I go.



      Heroes.



      Heroes.



      On your knees, knave.



      Can't you see we're talking?



      Talking is for wimps.



      You can't fool me
      with that macho facade.



      You're just afraid to show
      your sensitive side.



      You've touched my inner child.



      And he's really mad!



      Come on, Scoob.



      Miner   er!



      I'll get you, you varmints!



      Dead end.



      Remember when we were young
      and you used to wear that jumper?



      - What? Me? In a jumper?
      - And we used to watch cable?



      Do it!



      Lights out.



      Blackout! Blackout!



      Oh, crap.



      Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.



      Come on. Let's go, Scoob!



      My glasses.



      Oh, brother. Not again.



      I've got to consider contact lenses.



      What?



      Some kind of scary bat.



      Wait a minute.



      That's the pterodactyl.



      The Pterodactyl Ghost.



      What's this?



      A shrine!



      To Jonathan Jacobo?



      But who would be so obsessed with him?



      Velma.



      Lose something?



      Patrick.



      What are you doing here?



      I'm trying to solve this mystery.
      Same as you.



      That is what you're doing, right?
      Trying to solve this mystery?



      Yes.



      Why are you so obsessed
      with Jonathan Jacobo?



      - What are you talking about?
      - No way, Jose.



      Velma.



      Stay away from me.



      I know who you are.



      - Velma, let go of the grate.
      - So I can fall to my death?



      No, so I can pull you up.



      - You gotta trust me.
      - No. I only trust the facts.



      And all the facts say
      that you're the Evil Masked Figure.



      What does your heart say?



      I don't know.
      It's beating too loud for me to hear.



      Look deeper. You gotta trust me.



      You saved my life.



      Patrick!



      Velma!



      That thing just flew off with Patrick!



      The best we can do for him is get
      that control panel back where it belongs.



      Where is it?



      I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.



      That's weird. It sounded like you just said
      you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.



      I think we lost them.



      Scoob, we made it.



      You should never have locked those locks.



      Now you're stuck in here with me!



      The Cotton Candy Glob.



      - Cotton Candy Glob?
      - Cotton Candy Glob?



      Yes.



      - No! I'll give you cavities!
      - I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.



      Poor guys are probably running around
      helpless and terrified.



      This is like the greatest day
      of our lives, Scoob.



      Finally, a monster
      we could sink our teeth into.



      I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's
      a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?



      - Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
      - Come on.



      We have to get this
      control panel back before...



      Before exactly that happens.



      At last I have you, Mystery Inc.



      You'll never make it past my monsters.



      We've taken these jerks before, gang.
      Let's do it again.



      - Fred!
      - It's not them you need to worry about.



      Now you are stuck in my trap.



      Daphne!



      Daph!



      Gotcha!



      Go! Daphne!



      Run, Velma! Run, Velma!



      Shaggy! Here!



      Come on!



      Soon your friends will be dead...



      ...and Coolsville destroyed.



      My revenge will be final...



      ...and there's nothing you can do about it.



      Help, Velma!



      Daphne?



      - Shaggy?
      - Scoob...



      Dude.



      - Like, frostbite never felt so good!
      - Stop them!



      - Go long, Scoob!
      - Okay.



      Here, <div class="mention">dog</div>gy-<div class="mention">dog</div>gy.



      Rail glide!



      - Watch this!
      - Roll barrel!



      Hang time!



      End of the line, Doo!



      Come here, you worthless mutt!



      Scoob!



      You can do it, buddy!



      You can't do this to me!



      Who do you think you are?



      Scooby...



      ...Dooby...



      ...Doo!



      No!



      My monsters!



      You did it! You saved us all!



      I know.



      Do you know the identity
      of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?



      If our hunch is correct,
      the Evil Masked Figure is...



      No!



      Heather Jasper-Howe.



      But she was at the museum
      when the Masked Figure was on the roof.



      You almost had me there, didn't you?



      Lucky for her, she had an assistant
      helping her with her evil plans.



      Ned.



      When I realized
      she was the Evil Masked Figure...



      ... he quickly changed into her costume.



      But why did she do it?



      Because Heather Jasper-Howe
      is actually...



      ...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.



      The original Pterodactyl Ghost.



      But how do you know this?



      A photo, taken of Jacobo
      in front of the Coolsonian.



      Jacobo supposedly died
      a year before construction even began.



      So Jacobo survived that fall
      off the prison wall.



      He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe
      persona to turn the press against us.



      Then he framed Old Man Wickles...



      ...by putting that book and
      The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.



      As if you getting the lead
      in My Fair Lady wasn't enough!



      I was an excellent Eliza!
      You were too act-y.



      And stealing my Tater Tots!



      You kept saying you felt puffy!



      And the real identity of Ned is...



      Ned.



      I would have gotten away with it
      if it weren't for those meddling punks...



      ...and their dumb <div class="mention">dog</div>!



      - You were a dude this whole time?
      - Of course, dummkopf.



      But we cuddled.



      - Hi.
      - Hi.



      Listen, Velma, I know
      that must have seemed very suspicious...



      ...but you've got to believe me
      that I had nothing to do with...



      I trust you.



      Listen, Patrick.



      I'm not glamorous or mysterious.



      But one thing that's true is...



      ...that I like you.



      Very much.



      And I would like
      to go out with you again.



      But this time, I will go as myself.



      Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.



      Okay.



      Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!



      They're cheering for us again.



      Yep.



      I always thought that was
      the best thing in the world.



      I guess I found something
      a little bit better.



      - Can we get your photo in this?
      - Yes.



      Yikes! A monster!



      - Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
      - Shaggy!



      Scooby-Dooby-Doo!



      Sing it up, Ruben.



      Everybody.



      Come on, Shaggy.



      Get down.
